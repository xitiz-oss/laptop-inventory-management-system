<p id="description">The stock management system for the laptop shop was built with the objective to dynamically assist the admin of the shop with the task of updating all available stocks as well as being able to add a new stock and work with it whenever the admin buys or sells the laptop. The laptop shop can have voluminous number of transactions; thus it can take a diligent effort to be able to handle the tasks in the shop. Hence the system is built with this objective to fulfil the goal of making the work of admin easier by making it dynamic and functionality oriented. The system works with .txt file for accessing and updating stocks that is the usage of file handling concepts works in loop to provide a real-life scenario of a system uses try-except block which reflects on exception handling concepts works with various data structures for the respective operations. All things considered the system built is based around real-life scenario to meet the goals and requirements of a laptop shop with structured and dynamic stock updating.</p>
